# Figma variable binder — nonoun-color-tokens

There are **TWO** Figma plugins in `figma/`, and they are NOT the same artifact. Know which one a task
touches before you change a line — they share the Color Primitives → Color Modes vocabulary but differ in
who creates what:

| | **The standalone Binder** | **The app-as-plugin** |
|---|---|---|
| Path | `figma/binder/figma-semantic-binder/{code.js, manifest.json}` | `figma/plugin/{code.js, manifest.json, ui.html}` |
| Does | aliases an existing raw collection → a new aliased `Color Modes` | the full generator UI; `applyBundle` CREATES both collections, prunes, can rebuild |
| Needs | `Color Primitives` to ALREADY exist (else it notifies + closes) | nothing — it generates the raw colors too |
| `ui.html` | none (no UI) | the generated app bundle (`npm run gen:figma-ui` → `<nonoun-color-tokens>` + the bridge) |
| Verifier | `test/figma/binder.mjs` | `test/figma/plugin.mjs` |

The conceptual model — *why* aliasing is the only thing giving a live raw→semantic cascade — is owned by
`docs/spec/references/knowledge-05-figma-plugin.md`. **Cite it; don't re-derive it.** Role-table parity (the
`code.js#roleTable(n)` copy) is owned by `adding-semantic-roles` — **cite it; don't duplicate the procedure.**

## The four load-bearing constraints (depth in `references/foundations.md`)

1. **Offline, always.** Both manifests declare `networkAccess: { allowedDomains: ["none"] }` (ADR-010 /
   AC-P3). No `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest` / `WebSocket` / dynamic `import()`. This is *why* the app's fonts are
   base64-embedded in `ui.html` — there is no CDN. A network call is a hard gate failure, not a style choice.
2. **The sandbox can't import `.mjs`.** Figma plugin code runs in a non-module VM, so the standalone binder's
   `code.js` **HARDCODES** `roleTable(n)` — a verbatim copy of `semanticRoles(n)`. `figma/binder/bind-plan.mjs`
   is the pure, importable planner the verifier tests; `code.js` mirrors it. They MUST stay in lockstep
   (`adding-semantic-roles` step 4 owns the edit; the parity gate is in `references/foundations.md` §3/§4).
3. **The VM is jsvm-cpp, not modern V8.** Optional catch binding (`catch {` with no param, ES2019) PARSE-fails
   in Figma yet loads fine in Node — so a `node --check` (and the verifier's own `new Function` load) won't
   catch it. **Always write `catch (e) {`.** Both plugins follow this as a PRACTICE; the static guard is a
   GATE in `plugin.mjs` only (the `vmsyntax` check — real incident 2026-06-17). The binder's `code.js` also
   uses `catch (e)` (line 46) but is unguarded — so be disciplined there.
4. **Never surface a raw error to the user.** Figma policy rejects plugins that show a stack/`e.message`.
   `main().catch(...)` (binder) / the message handler's `catch (e)` (app) logs the detail to `console.error`
   and `figma.notify`s a friendly line. Both verifiers' `compliance` check greps for
   `figma.notify(...e.message/String(e)/.stack...)` and fails the run on a hit.

## The two flows (depth in `references/foundations.md`)

**Standalone binder** (`figma/binder/figma-semantic-binder/code.js`, read it): find the `Color Primitives`
collection → index its vars by name → create/find `Color Modes` with Light + Dark modes → for each of the 8
`PALETTES`, for each role in `roleTable(n)`, resolve `rawVars["{n}/{refKey(ref)}"]` for light and dark →
`createVariableAlias(rawVar)` into each mode via `setValueForMode`. Reports `bound` + any `missing` raw
targets. The grammar `"{n}/{refKey(ref)}"` is load-bearing: every emitted target is GUARANTEED to be a
canonical raw-colors name (solid → pad3 `"50"→"050"`; scrim → `"500-{step}"` verbatim).

**App apply path** (grep `src/ui/app.js`): the buttons call `requestApplyToFigma(rebuild)` →
`renderApplyGate()` (a consent road-block: *back up your file first*; normal apply is cookieable via a
versioned localStorage key, the destructive **Regroup** ALWAYS warns) → `applyToFigma` posts
`{type:"apply", dtcg: this.figmaBundle(), config: serialize(this.doc), rebuildSemantic}`.
`figma/plugin/code.js#applyBundle` creates Color Primitives + Color Modes, prunes orphans, embeds the config
in `figma.root` pluginData. Round-trip OUT: `configFromVariables` (`src/ui/model.mjs`) recovers each family's
500 hue/chroma from the live raw vars (the APPROXIMATE fallback when no config is embedded); `read-variables`
→ `receiveLiveVariables` feeds the drift diff. Geometry rides a separate `Geometry` collection of Figma
NUMBER (FLOAT) vars via `geomTokensFigma` (`src/engine/geometry.mjs`).

## Procedure

1. **Identify the plugin.** Standalone binder vs app-as-plugin (the table above). A "binder skipped roles"
   bug is the binder's `missing` list (a raw target absent — check pad3 + scrim grammar). An "apply did
   nothing / duplicated" bug is the app's `applyBundle`.
2. **If the role set changed**, this is an `adding-semantic-roles` task — the binder's `roleTable(n)` is one
   of its parity sites. Do NOT hand-edit the role rows here in isolation; follow that skill's lockstep so the
   answer key, the `.mjs` planner, the count literals, and this copy all move together.
3. **Keep it offline + VM-safe.** No network API; `catch (e) {` not `catch {`; no raw error in `figma.notify`;
   no remote `import()`. (The app verifier also requires the `ui.html` bridge — `figma-init` / `pluginMessage`
   / `figmaBundle` / `config-loaded`→`applyLoadedConfig` / `variables-read`→`receiveLiveVariables`.)
4. **If you touched the binder's `roleTable`/`refKey`/grammar**, re-derive the target set against
   `bind-plan.mjs` (the parity gate does this) — every `"{n}/{refKey}"` must be in the canonical raw name set,
   no dangling `"{n}/50"`, no out-of-range scrim step.
5. **If you regenerated the app bundle**, run `npm run gen:figma-ui` so `figma/plugin/ui.html` is current
   (`npm test` runs it for you; a stale `ui.html` fails the `ui` gate). Never hand-edit `ui.html` — it is
   generated from `dist/nonoun-color-tokens.html`.

## Validate (draft → check → fix → re-check)

Run the two pure Figma verifiers first, then the full suite. Each prints `pass`/`FAIL` per group; a
`compliance` or `parse` failure (collected, not printed as its own line) still fails the run:

```
node test/figma/binder.mjs   # prints: bindings · offline · parity. Also runs (unprinted, but run-failing):
                             #   code.js node --check, compliance (no raw-error/HCT, main().catch wraps).
                             #   bindings = bindingPlan length 53 × palettes + every target in the canonical raw set;
                             #   offline = manifest { allowedDomains:["none"] } + main:"code.js"; parity = roleTable↔bind-plan ref-set.
node test/figma/plugin.mjs   # prints: manifest · offline · vmsyntax · ui · parse · apply · cascade · idempotent · prune · config · read.
                             #   (compliance is checked here too — run-failing, not a printed line.)
                             #   vmsyntax = NO `catch {`; cascade = every sem mode-value aliases a CREATED raw var.
npm test                     # test/run.mjs runs figma/plugin.mjs + figma/binder.mjs + the engine/ui suite.
```

The gate that catches a drifted binder copy is **`parity`** in `binder.mjs` (it loads `roleTable`/`refKey`
out of `code.js` via `new Function`, strips the top-level `main();`, and diffs the derived ref-target SET both
directions against `bindingTargets(NAMES)` — the real 2026-06-18 scrim drift). The gate that catches a
sandbox-only syntax break is **`vmsyntax`** in `plugin.mjs` (`catch {`). Don't call it done until both pure
verifiers and `npm test` are green.
